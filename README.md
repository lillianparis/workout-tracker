## Description
This webpage features a workout tracker, that will implement a mongoose database with a mongoose schema and handle routes with express.


## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

## Usage
As a user, I want to be able to view, create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I want to also be able to track a name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercises. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
